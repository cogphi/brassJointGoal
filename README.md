# How to run it

Install opensesame_3.0.7-osx-1

If necessary: Open preferences, select run in same process.

(opensesame 3.2 did not appear to work: it gave import error, module cv2 not found. If you encounter this, you need to install opencv-python. On windows, open opensesame as administrator and use the built in package manager to install it.)
